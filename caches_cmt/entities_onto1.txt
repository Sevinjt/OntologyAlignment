In CMT terms, a ‘Conflict of Interest’ is an association between a specific Reviewer and a specific Paper that states there is a conflict of interest between that Reviewer and that paper. Conflicts can be marked by Authors (during paper submission) or by Reviewers (in Phase 2) or by Chairmen (in Phase 3).

Based on that conflict, the reviewer will not be able to bid on the paper, be assigned to that paper (either automatically by the system or manually by a Chairman) or view review submissions for that paper.

A special type of Reviewer.  There can be any number of Reviewers for a given paper, but only one Meta-Reviewer.  The Meta-Reviewer can go over all the reviews submitted for the paper and submit their own review.  Questions for the Meta-Reviewer can be different from those for a normal Reviewer.  Their role is to ensure that the reviews are good and consistent. The decision to use Meta-Reviewers is optional, and must be set before paper assignment occurs.
